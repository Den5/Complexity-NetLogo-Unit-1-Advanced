Complexity-NetLogo Assignment 1 Advanced from the 'Introduction to Complexity Course' https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/89-introduction-to-complexity Create a simple ant colony using NetLogo.

Same as the Intermediate Option, but when returning to the nest, the ant leaves a
pheromone trail—that is, the patches that it traverses each gain a unit of pheromone. The
pheromone evaporates over time—that is, at every time step each patch with pheromone
has a probability of losing its pheromone. If a wandering ant encounters a patch with
pheromone, it follows the trail as long as it can sense pheromone.
